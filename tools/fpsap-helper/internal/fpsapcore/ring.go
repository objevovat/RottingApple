// than re-derive that with four divisions per iteration -- 3,360 per hash --
// they are tabulated once, using the identical uint32 arithmetic.
// Built as variable initialisers, not in an init(): descStateAt128 in fast.go
// is computed by an init() that calls fairplaySAPHash, and Go runs every
// variable initialiser before any init(), which is the ordering this needs.
