// SupportedFPSAPMode is the only FairPlay message mode this package can answer.
//
// An m2 selects a mode in byte 13, and the mode picks both the CBC IV and the
// AES round keys used for the message body -- so the same 128-byte challenge
// produces four entirely different responses under modes 0..3. Our Phase 1 is
// white-box AES over baked T-boxes, and those tables encode mode 3's key
// schedule alone; there is no parameter that could select another.
//
// Verified against omarroth/doubletake, which implements all four: for the same
// payload, FPExchangeNative reproduces their mode 3 byte for byte and matches
// none of modes 0, 1 or 2.

// FPSAPExchangeM3 computes the FairPlay SAP m3 response for a given m2 message.
// It returns the full 164-byte m3: a 144-byte prefix followed by the 20-byte
// challenge response.
//
// It builds with a plain `go build`, embeds no Apple snapshot, and runs no ARM64
// interpreter. The 20-byte response is the well-tested part: 142/142 archived
// golden vectors, plus eight vectors from two independent emulator-based senders
// (see external_vectors_test.go).
//
// # Two limitations, and only one of them is recoverable by the caller
//
// Mode. An m2 that selects anything other than mode 3 is rejected with an
// error. Answering it would mean emitting a response derived from the wrong key
// schedule -- wrong bytes presented as an answer, which is worse than a refusal.
// Before 2026-08-01 this function ignored byte 13 entirely and replied as though
// every m2 had asked for mode 3.
//
// Session replay. The 144-byte prefix is a constant, so every m3 this function
// emits carries the same local SAP. Real senders generate that SAP per session
// and encrypt it into the m3 body. Receivers that validate the body reject the
// replay: omarroth/doubletake#17 reports RTSP/1.0 466 Key Management Error from
// an AppleTV3,2, and doubletake removed its own hardcoded prefix in e544a88
// (2026-07-20) to fix it. Fixing it here needs a per-session localSAP encrypted
// with the mode's round keys, which this package does not carry.
//
// So: trust FPExchangeBlobless, and treat this framing as a reference that works
// against permissive mode-3 receivers only. Callers wanting broad device
// compatibility need a session-aware m3 body.
