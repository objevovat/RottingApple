//
// for mode 0..3 on the payload built here. doubletake reaches this by a
// different route -- an inverse-AES loop with per-mode round keys, where ours is
// white-box AES over baked T-boxes -- so agreement is evidence, not tautology.
//
// The point is the disagreement as much as the agreement: modes 0, 1 and 2 give
// completely different answers, and there is no parameter in this package that
// could produce them. That is why FPSAPExchangeM3 refuses them rather than
// replying with mode 3's answer.
